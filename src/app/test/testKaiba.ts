    "wikitext": "Kaiba mainly runs Decks that centralize on a [[beatdown]] strategy to aggressively overwhelm his opponents with high ATK monsters. During the first several arcs of the Yu-Gi-Oh anime, his Deck is composed of vicious-looking monsters, with most of them being [[DARK]] [[Fiend]]-Type. The Spells and Traps in his Deck normally serve to disrupt and counter any strategies his opponents would use. His monster lineup is spearheaded by his signature card, \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\" and its Fusion form, \"[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]\". In the later arcs, he incorporates \"[[Virus]]\" cards such as \"[[Giant Germ (anime)|Giant Germ]]\", \"[[Crush Card]]\", and \"[[Virus Cannon (anime)|Virus Cannon]]\" that give it the traits of a Virus Control Deck and [[swarm]] Deck, destroying all monsters in his opponent's Deck with more than 1500 ATK, further crippling their ability to defend against him.  \n\nAs the series evolves, Kaiba's switches his focus towards [[Dragon]]-Type monsters. His later Decks are composed of a diverse lineup of Dragon-Type monsters and Dragon-Type support cards such as \"[[Spear Dragon (anime)|Spear Dragon]]\", \"[[Luster Dragon 2 (anime)|Luster Dragon #2]]\", \n[[Different Dimension Dragon (anime)|Different Dimension Dragon]]\", \"[[Paladin of White Dragon (anime)|Paladin of White Dragon]]\", and \"[[Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End (anime)|Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End]]\" while still maintaining \"Blue Eyes White Dragon\" and \"Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon\" as his most aggressive boss monsters. His later Decks still retain much of the aggressive beatdown strategies to wreak havoc upon his opponents with high ATK incorporated with Dragon-type support cards that contain inherent self-protection effects. \n\n==NAS anime==\n===Childhood Deck===\nThis Deck is seen in a flashback during the [[Virtual World (arc)|Virtual World]] arc.

[[Ghost Kaiba]] also utilized Kaiba's Deck and the [[Duel Computer]] also used some of his cards when Kaiba wanted to test [[Duel Disk#Duel Disk (version 2)|his new Duel Disk system]]. Notably, his signature card (through all seasons of the anime and manga) is the \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\". His main plan consists of using \"[[Saggi the Dark Clown (anime)|Saggi the Dark Clown]]\" as bait, then use \"[[Crush Card]]\" to destroy the opponent's Deck. Against Yugi he tries regaining Life Points or destroying the opponents cards to stall until he draws the right cards required for Summoning \"[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]\" for the final blow.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Decklist\n|normal monsters =\n* [[Aqua Madoor (anime)|Aqua Madoor]]<ref group=Notes name=test>Used by [[Duel Computer]].</ref>\n* [[Battle Ox (anime)|Battle Ox]]\n* [[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] x3\n* [[Grappler (anime)|Grappler]]\n* [[Gyakutenno Megami (anime)|Gyakutenno Megami]]<ref group=Notes name=gun>This card is used to jam the gun of one of [[Maximillion Pegasus|Pegasus]]' henchmen in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 030|episode 30]].

He serves as the second main antagonist of the final third of season three after [[Brron, Mad King of Dark World (character)|Brron]] and his Dark World Army are defeated, starting from [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Episode 136|episode 136]] until his defeat in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Episode 143|episode 143]]. \n\nAccording to [[Bastion Misawa]] (and later confirmed by [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]] herself), it was Yubel who orchestrated the possession of the King over Jaden, with the intent of taking [[The Gentle Darkness]], and ruling over the united twelve [[Duel Spirit Dimension|dimensions]] together.\n\n==Design==\n===Appearance===\n[[File:Haou lineart.jpg|thumb|left|Linework]]\nThe Supreme King is a shadowed figure dressed in black and gold medieval knight-esque armor with six tendril-like spikes, two jutting out of the armor's back and four jutting out of the shoulders, a headdress with a tall collar and a floor-length red cape. To signify his position as the Supreme King, he also wears a black helmet that functions as a crown. When he possesses [[Jaden Yuki|Jaden]], he dons his aforementioned outfit and Jaden's eyes become golden, giving him a somewhat demonic look. Jaden's face also elicits anger and hatred through a constant scowl, and he speaks in a bland monotone (in the dub, his voice is coarser than usual). \n\n===Personality===\nUnlike [[Jaden Yuki|Jaden]], The Supreme King is cold, collected, arrogant, ruthless, and merciless, but always carries an air of intimidation as noted by Axel Brodie. The Supreme King is also quite condescending, often mocking his opponent as he sees their efforts as futile because they are weak in his eyes, although he doesn't deviate from his reserved attitude while doing so. As the Supreme King, his cruelty has no bounds as he is willing to sacrifice as many people as he has to in order to accomplish his goals along with his lack of remorse after defeating someone himself. However, he doesn't actively hunt for opponents; this was shown when he let [[Axel Brodie|Axel]] leave his castle without giving chase after defeating [[Jim Crocodile Cook]], and he only Dueled Jim because it was the latter that challenged him.\n\n[[File:TheSupremeKing.gif|thumb|220x220px|The Supreme King reveals himself as Jaden.]]\nThe Supreme King is also quite taciturn  and succinct, only talking when it is required or to spite his enemies. He, of course, does have a small sense of humor, as when he was chuckling softly when Axel thought he'd gotten the upper hand.\n\n===Voice and mannerisms===\nAlthough [[Jaden Yuki|Jaden]] and The Supreme King are both played by the same voice actor ([[KENN]] in the Japanese version and [[Matthew Charles]] in the English version), their voices are very different. In the Japanese version, The Supreme King's voice is much deeper and foreboding in Jaden's subconscious while it is still Jaden's voice, but harsher and forceful on the outside though it is in monotone. In the dub, his voice is a harsher version of Jaden's voice complete with electronic effects; while his voice does show emotion, it is never anything more than anger.\n\n===Abilities===\nThe King wields the mighty [[the Gentle Darkness|Gentle Darkness]], the power which opposes [[the Light of Destruction]].<ref name=\"ep155\"/> He can emit darkness powerful enough to generate shock waves<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|139|ref}}</ref><ref name=\"ep140\"/> and to create a dark aura around himself, which can increase itself enough to become a miasma.<ref name=\"ep143\"/> While Dueling, his opponents as well as spectators feel an enormous pressure coming from him,<ref name=\"ep140\"/> which can later result in them becoming afraid of him.<ref name=\"ep140\"/><ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|141|ref}}</ref> \n\nWith the power of the Gentle Darkness to command Duel Monster Spirits, he possesses incredible leadership skills as seen when he formed his own army, declared himself the new monarch of the alternate dimension, and conquered large territories of that world in only a couple of days.\n\n==Biography==\n===Dimension World===\nThe Supreme King is first mentioned by [[Sky Scout (character)|Sky Scout]], after the latter was defeated by [[Jaden Yuki]]. Amazed by Jaden's courage and equity, Sky Scout begs Jaden to defeat the evil that rules his world (the Supreme King) and to become King himself.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|132|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jadens eyes.png|thumb|250px|Jaden's eyes turn golden when the Supreme Kng is awakened.]]\nAs Jaden went deeper into the alternate dimension, he could not control his emotions, especially anger and hatred, which resulted the awakening of his dormant powers. When [[Zure, Knight of Dark World (character)|Zure, Knight of Dark World]] killed a boy, who resembled [[Jesse Anderson]], a glowing aura appeared around Jaden and Zure remarked that he is not like the other Duelists.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|133|ref}}</ref> When several of Jaden's friends were sacrificed during the Duel with [[Brron, Mad King of Dark World (character)|Brron, Mad King of Dark World]], Jaden let his hatred and anger to take control over him which awakened the Supreme King's powers inside himself. Jaden, unfortunately used that powers in the Duel to get revenge on Brron for the loss of his friends. Although the Duel ended with Jaden's victory, his remaining friends were disappointed by his action and left him alone.<ref name=\"ep136\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|136|ref}}</ref> \n\nAfter the Duel the spirit of the Supreme King reacts to Jaden's negative emotions and tempts him to evil with the \"[[Super Polymerization (anime)|Super Polymerization]]\" card that Brron previously tried to complete. He suggests that to truly defeat evil, an shocked Jaden himself must become evil. He successfully convinces Jaden, as thus far, being heroic had done nothing but get his friends killed.<ref name=\"ep136\"/> While in control, his first action is mobilizing an army to slaughter numerous Duelists in order to complete the \"Super Polymerization\" card.<ref name=\"ep138\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|138|ref}}</ref> He later begins to oppress many local villages, coercing their allegiance through strong-arm tactics and sets his eyes on a village that serves as his primary resistance for a trap for the survivors of his attacks.\n\n[[File:Supreme King Mirrors.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Supreme King talks to [[Jaden Yuki|Jaden]] from within his mind.]]\nHe commands an army of ruthless minions capable of decimating entire villages; with his most prominent underlings are called the [[The Duelists of Death]], which consist of [[Guardian Baou (character)|Guardian Baou]], [[Chaos Sorcerer (character)|Chaos Sorcerer]], [[Skilled White Magician (character)|Skilled White Magician]], [[Skilled Dark Magician (character)|Skilled Dark Magician]], the former two actually being [[Demise, King of Armageddon (character)|Demise, King of Armageddon]] and [[Skull Knight (character)|Skull Knight]].<ref name=\"ep138\"/>\n\n[[File:Kaiba222Yu-Gi-OhGXEpisode140 Jaden in the Darkness.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jaden Yuki]] lost in the darkness]]\nUltimately, The Supreme King fails in his quest due to the efforts of [[Jim Crocodile Cook]], [[Axel Brodie]], [[Aster Phoenix]], [[Zane Truesdale]] and indirectly, [[Syrus Truesdale]]. Although Jim's Duel with The Supreme King leads to Jim losing his life, Axel was able to recover his [[Eye of Orichalcum|eye]].<ref name=\"ep140\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|140|ref}}</ref>  Later with the help of Aster and Zane, Axel invades The Supreme King's castle.<ref name=\"ep142\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|142|ref}}</ref> He [[DRAW|ties]] with The Supreme King in a Duel and then uses the Eye of Orichalcum to free Jaden, at the cost of his own life. Zane then throws The Supreme King's helmet to the army in order to show them that their ruler has truly fallen and the army disperses soon after.<ref name=\"ep143\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|143|ref}}</ref> The Supreme King would later come to haunt Jaden's past as a constant reminder of the atrocities he committed.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|144|ref}}</ref><ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|146|ref}}</ref> In his Duel against a [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]]-possessed [[Jesse Anderson]], Jaden uses the \"Super Polymerization\" card which he used as the Supreme King, summoning \"[[Rainbow Neos (anime)|Rainbow Neos]]\". However, Yubel plays \"[[Last Trick]]\" giving her possession of the \"Super Polymerization\" card.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|152|ref}}</ref> [[Bastion Misawa]] has previously told Jaden that The Supreme King is the dark half of Jaden's soul—however, he is not complete without him. Only by mastering the powers of The Supreme King without falling into inner darkness can Jaden truly become complete. Even [[Guardian Baou (character)|Baou]]<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|147|ref}}</ref>, former Supreme King's underling, and Yubel stated they are the same person. Jaden mastered The Supreme King inside himself during the final Duel with Yubel.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|153|ref}}</ref><ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|154|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jaden SupremeKingEyes.png|thumb|250px|Jaden using the Supreme King's powers during the final battle against Yubel]][[File:Young Haou.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The young King.]] \nDuring the final Duel with Yubel, the true nature of The Supreme King is exposed: The Supreme King was once a resident (prince in the dub) of an unnamed kingdom, destined to battle [[The Light of Destruction]], and a close friend to a once-human Yubel. Because of how young he was at the time, Yubel offered to be transformed into a Duel Monster to protect him, an act that moved the King to the point of devoting himself to loving his only friend. His spirit would later be dormant within Jaden, until it was awakened by Yubel's machinations. This realization gives Jaden the strength to forgive Yubel for what she's done, and to use \"Super Polymerization\" to fuse her within himself, reuniting Yubel and the King for all time. The flashback King looked almost exactly like Jaden (he just looked younger, he also lacked the demonic looking eyes he had when he has currently). It is stated that The Supreme King was later passed on to his reincarnation Jaden, but under the corruption of his own feelings of animosity and austerity, prior to having to have lost his trust and his friends.<ref name=\"ep155\"/>\n\nAs Jaden activated \"[[Spiritual Fusion]]\", the spirit of the King appeared once more, but he looked like Jaden in his current age. He tells her that the true enemy is The Light of Destruction, and that she will be purified from its influence and her soul will be fused with his forever.<ref name=\"ep155\"/>\n\n===Darkness===\nAlthough the Supreme King makes no further appearances, he is shown in flashbacks during [[Jaden Yuki|Jaden]]'s Duel with [[Nightshroud]]<ref name=\"ep178\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|178|ref}}</ref> as well as in a flashback during the former's Duel with [[Yugi Muto]] and [[Yami Yugi]].<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|180|ref}}</ref> Jaden possesses both the King's and [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]]'s powers. He gains golden eyes more than once, before they turn to Yubel's bichromatic style, and manifests the power of generating wind during his second Duel with [[Sartorius]].<ref name=\"ep171\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|171|ref}}</ref> During this Duel, Jaden tells Sartorius that there is no power which can control destiny. However, Sartorius counters by telling that he should know the allure of power more than anyone—having been controlled by The Supreme King. Jaden responds that such power no longer seduces him—and that power shouldn't be used to fulfill your own selfish desires, it should be used to serve a higher purpose.<ref name=\"ep171\"/> \n\nDuring the final Duel with Nightshroud, before her card was removed from play, Yubel reminded Jaden that he must believe in his own powers in order to win the Duel. Nightshroud tried to convince him that it's hopeless and he should surrender—he is alone, and no one else can fight. Jaden tells him he's wrong, stating that he's not the strong one. His soul was once drowned in darkness, and he hurt many of his friends—but that taught him something—to believe in the power of friendship and the strength of one's cards.<ref name=\"ep178\"/>\n{{-}}\n==Decks==\n===Anime===\nThe Supreme King plays an '''\"[[Evil HERO|Evil Hero]]\" Deck''', vile incarnations of [[Jaden Yuki|Jaden]]'s \"[[Elemental HERO|Elemental Hero]]es\". Like Jaden, The Supreme King's tactics revolve around [[Fusion Summon]]ing, except he uses his own signature card, \"[[Dark Fusion (anime)|Dark Fusion]]\", a warped version of Jaden's traditional \"[[Polymerization (anime)|Polymerization]]\" that prevents the [[Fusion Monster|monster]] being destroyed by [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s during the turn it was Summoned. The Supreme King also has access to \"[[Super Polymerization (anime)|Super Polymerization]]\", which can use monsters from both sides of the [[field]] as Fusion material and can't be [[negate]]d by [[card effect|effects]]. It is able to bring out any kind of high-[[Level]] Fusion Monster with dreadful effects in an instant. Many of his \"Evil Hero\" versions of Jaden's \"Elemental Heroes\" possess stronger effects than their good counterparts.\n\nUnlike Jaden, whose unorthodox plays depend on chance, The Supreme King is straightforward and his arsenal uses a variety of effects that range from card destruction to immunity from opposing card effects that effectively reflect the supremacy and omnipotence of a monarch. The Supreme King possesses [[alternate art]] versions of Elemental Heroes \"[[Elemental Hero Avian (anime)|Avian]]\", \"[[Elemental Hero Burstinatrix (anime)|Burstinatrix]]\", \"[[Elemental Hero Sparkman (anime)|Sparkman]]\" and \"[[Elemental Hero Wildheart (anime)|Wildheart]]\".\n\n{{Decklist|Evil Hero Deck\n|normal monsters =\n* [[Elemental Hero Avian (anime)|Elemental Hero Avian]]\n* [[Elemental Hero Burstinatrix (anime)|Elemental Hero Burstinatrix]]\n* [[Elemental Hero Clayman (anime)|Elemental Hero Clayman]]\n* [[Elemental Hero Neos (anime)|Elemental Hero Neos]]<ref group=Notes name=goblins>This card can be seen on the ground in a flashback during [[Yu-Gi-Oh!
